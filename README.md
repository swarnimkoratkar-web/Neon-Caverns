## *Problem Description*

Many modern mobile games are overloaded with competitive mechanics, micro-rewards, and addictive loops that lead to “brain-rotting” gameplay.
Players often feel overwhelmed by complicated systems, pay-to-win structures, and constant pressure to compete.

## *Project Solution*

*Neon Caverns* offers a refreshing alternative by providing a *simple, enjoyable, retro-style endless runner* experience. The game focuses on:

* *Pure gameplay* without overwhelming competitive elements
* *Smooth endless runner mechanics*
* *Neon-themed visuals* with bloom lighting for aesthetic immersion
* *Simple pick-up-and-play design* suited for casual mobile players

This gives users a relaxing, fun experience rather than a high-pressure one.
